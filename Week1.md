## Introduction
Have you tried balancing a stick on one end with your palm? It is difficult the first time one tries, but with some practice, one could stabilize the stick around the vertical position more or less for a certain duration of time. One who tries this would certainly agree that the act of balancing a stick requires a great deal of fine control.

The above example is just one of the many instances around us where things need to be controlled. Control refers to the action of trying to bring about desired behaviour/ properties in the state of a system, which is obvious. Many devices which seem to work like a charm require a good amount of control in the background for them to function properly. This is required for various reasons, such as ensuring that unwanted factors like noise or disturbances do not jeopardize their working, ensuring optimal resource usage, and maintaining stability.
If you don’t want your systems to go out of control, this is the place to know a few basic ideas behind controlling.
