# Week 1


## Introduction
Have you tried balancing a stick on one end with your palm? It is difficult the first time one tries, but with some practice, one could stabilize the stick around the vertical position more or less for a certain duration of time. One who tries this would certainly agree that the act of balancing a stick requires a great deal of fine control.

The above example is just one of the many instances around us where things need to be controlled. Control refers to the action of trying to bring about desired behaviour/ properties in the state of a system, which is obvious. Many devices which seem to work like a charm require a good amount of control in the background for them to function properly. This is required for various reasons, such as ensuring that unwanted factors like noise or disturbances do not jeopardize their working, ensuring optimal resource usage, and maintaining stability.
If you don‚Äôt want your systems to go out of control, this is the place to know a few basic ideas behind controlling.

Anybody who wishes to know more about control theory will certainly refer to this at some point, so here is the link to get started‚Ä¶

## Overview
The following broad topics will be covered this week-

*	Control Systems, their types and features
* Model representation using differential equations and transfer functions
*	Stability and Controllability
*	Introduction to PID Control

## Control systems

**Control system**- A collection of components that are collectively responsible for bringing the output of the system to the one desired by the input.

The **input** consists of parameters that dictate what the desired output should be. 

The **output** consists of a set of variables that describe the features of the system, collectively referred to as the state of the system. The state of a system is generally represented by ùë•.
**Example** ‚Äî position and velocity of a car.

A control system generally consists of the following components - 

**Plant** ‚Äî The part of the control system that is being controlled. It consists of the actuator, which executes the control command, and the process which responds to the actuation and undergoes a time evolution. In many cases, the plant could be a dynamic system like a car or a pendulum.

**Controller** ‚Äî The part of the control system that provides control commands to the plant so that the state gets driven to the desired one. The control command is generally represented by ùë¢.

**Sensors** ‚Äî The part of the control system that takes an observation/measurement of the state completely or partially. The sensor observation is generally represented by ùë¶.

## Types of control systems

**Open Loop control systems**
Applying control commands without taking any measurements of the output

**Closed Loop control systems/ Feedback control systems**
Applying control commands based on the measurements of the output with the help of a controller

**Advantages of Closed Loop control** - 
* Greater resistance to noise/bias/disturbances to the system
*	Efficient energy consumption
*	Alter the dynamic properties of the overall system
