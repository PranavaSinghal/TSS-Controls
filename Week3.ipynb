    "\n",
    "### What is it? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a programming language and numeric computing environment used for various scientific and engineering applications such as matrix manipulation, plotting data and design dynamic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are we using it?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the lectures of previous weeks, it might have become clear that MATLAB is a powerful tool that helps us model, design and analyze control systems. Thus, it would be great to get exposed to the utility of MATLAB so that one can implement their own ideas and try things out on their own. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the following video by Mathworks to install MATLAB. It is preferable to download the current stable release **(R2021a)** in case you haven't done it already. The video description has links to some of the common problems one might face during installation, so check them out in case of any issues.\n",

    "The best way to get started is to go through the **MATLAB OnRamp** course. It introduces most of the basic concepts that will be utilized this week in the most interactive way imaginable. If you are comfortable with programming in languages like C++ or Python, many of the basic programming concepts should be easy and the only thing you would need to adjust to is the syntax.\n",
